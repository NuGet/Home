## Summary

This specifies the syntax and behavior for the `dotnet nuget trust` command.

## Motivation

This is part of a larger effort to reach full parity between `nuget` and
`dotnet` for NuGet-related operations.

## Explanation

### Functional explanation

#### `> dotnet nuget trust`

```
Manage the trusted signers. By default, NuGet accepts all authors and repositories. These commands allow you to specify only a specific subset of signers whose signatures will be accepted, while rejecting all others.

USAGE:
    dotnet nuget trust [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]

COMMANDS:
    list
    author <name> <package>...
    repository <name> <package>...
    source <name> [source-url]
    certificate <name> <fingerprint>
    remove <name>
    sync <name>
```

#### `> dotnet nuget trust list`

```
Lists all the trusted signers in the configuration. This option will include all the certificates (with fingerprint and fingerprint algorithm) each signer has. If a certificate has a preceding [U], it means that certificate entry has allowUntrustedRoot set as true.

USAGE:
    dotnet nuget trust list [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help                          Prints help information.
    -v, --verbosity <LEVEL>             Set the verbosity level. Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
    -i, --interactive                   Allows command to stop and wait for user input or action.
        --configfile                    Specific NuGet file that should be used instead of the standard hierarchy.
```

#### `> dotnet nuget trust sync`

```
Deletes the current list of certificates and replaces them with an up-to-date list from the repository.

USAGE:
    dotnet nuget trust sync [OPTIONS] <name>

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help                          Prints help information.
    -v, --verbosity <LEVEL>             Set the verbosity level. Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
    -i, --interactive                   Allows command to stop and wait for user input or action.
        --configfile                    Specific NuGet file that should be used instead of the standard hierarchy.
```

#### `> dotnet nuget trust remove`

```
Removes any trusted signers that match the given name.

USAGE:
    dotnet nuget trust remove [OPTIONS] <name>

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help                          Prints help information.
    -v, --verbosity <LEVEL>             Set the verbosity level. Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
    -i, --interactive                   Allows command to stop and wait for user input or action.
        --configfile                    Specific NuGet file that should be used instead of the standard hierarchy.
```

#### `> dotnet nuget trust author`

```
Adds a trusted signer with the given name, based on the author signature(s) of one or more packages. If <name> already exists in the configuration, the signature(s) will be appended. The given <package>s should be local paths to signed .nupkg files.

USAGE:
    dotnet nuget trust author [OPTIONS] <name> <package>...

EXAMPLE:
    dotnet nuget trust author Contoso ./contoso.library.nupkg

OPTIONS:
        --allow-untrusted-root          Specifies if the certificate for the trusted signer should be allowed to chain to an untrusted root.
    -h, --help                          Prints help information.
    -v, --verbosity <LEVEL>             Set the verbosity level. Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
    -i, --interactive                   Allows command to stop and wait for user input or action.
        --configfile                    Specific NuGet file that should be used instead of the standard hierarchy.
```

##### NOTE

For `trust author` and `trust repository`, `<package>` may be a glob/wildcard.
This must be consistent across platforms, so the Windows version must expand
these wildcards when it receives them as arguments.

#### `> dotnet nuget trust repository`

```
Adds a trusted signer with the given name, based on the repository signature(s) or countersignature(s) of one or more packages. If <name> already exists in the configuration, the signature(s) will be appended. The given <package>s should be local paths to signed .nupkg files.

USAGE:
    dotnet nuget trust repository [OPTIONS] <name> <package>...

OPTIONS:
        --allow-untrusted-root          Specifies if the certificate for the trusted signer should be allowed to chain to an untrusted root. This is not recommended.
        --owners                        Semi-colon separated list of trusted owners to further restrict the trust of a repository.
    -h, --help                          Prints help information.
    -v, --verbosity <LEVEL>             Set the verbosity level. Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
    -i, --interactive                   Allows command to stop and wait for user input or action.
        --configfile                    Specific NuGet file that should be used instead of the standard hierarchy.
```

##### NOTE

For `trust author` and `trust repository`, `<package>` may be a glob/wildcard.
This must be consistent across platforms, so the Windows version must expand
these wildcards when it receives them as arguments.

#### `> dotnet nuget trust certificate`

```
Adds a trusted signer with the given name, based on a certificate fingerprint.

If a trusted signer with the given name already exists, the certificate item will be added to that signer. Otherwise a trusted author will be created with a certificate item from given certificate information.

USAGE:
    dotnet nuget trust certificate [OPTIONS] <name> <fingerprint>

OPTIONS:
        --allow-untrusted-root          Specifies if the certificate for the trusted signer should be allowed to chain to an untrusted root.
        --algorithm                     Specifies the hash algorithm used to calculate the certificate fingerprint. Defaults to SHA256. Values supported are SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512
    -h, --help                          Prints help information.
    -v, --verbosity <LEVEL>             Set the verbosity level. Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
    -i, --interactive                   Allows command to stop and wait for user input or action.
        --configfile                    Specific NuGet file that should be used instead of the standard hierarchy.
```

#### `> dotnet nuget trust source`

```
Adds a trusted signer based on a given package source.

If only `<name>` is provided without `<source-url>`, the package source from your NuGet configuration files with the same name will be added to the trusted list.

If a `<source-url>` is provided, it MUST be a v3 package source URL (like https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json). Other package source types are not supported.

If <name> already exists in the configuration, the package source will be appended to it.

USAGE:
    dotnet nuget trust source <name> [source-url]

OPTIONS:
        --allow-untrusted-root          Specifies if the certificate for the trusted signer should be allowed to chain to an untrusted root.
        --owners                        Semi-colon separated list of trusted owners to further restrict the trust of a repository.
    -h, --help                          Prints help information.
    -v, --verbosity <LEVEL>             Set the verbosity level. Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
    -i, --interactive                   Allows command to stop and wait for user input or action.
        --configfile                    Specific NuGet file that should be used instead of the standard hierarchy.

```

### Technical explanation

For the most part, these commands map pretty directly to their nuget
counterparts, and most of their implementations should be reusable (removing
`#if IS_DESKTOP` as needed, from the various TrustedSigners classes).

The exception here is the `add` command, which has been split into separate
commands that otherwise have the same behaviors, since options and semantics
can vary significantly.

I don't know if there's any significant implementation above just remapping
command invocations for dotnet.

Additionally, `trust author` and `trust repository` must both not just accept
multiple `<package>` arguments, but must manually expand globbed arguments on
Windows, since powershell and cmd.exe don't do glob/wildcard expansions at the
shell level like \*nix shells do.

## Drawbacks

This whole feature is very complicated, but it's important for parity.

## Rationale and alternatives

I think the only one that might have a reasonable alternative here would be
the `add` command. I found the command as a whole to be inscrutable, and thus
decided splitting its behavior to be the best way forward. We could have, of
course, mostly just copied the behavior from `nuget trusted-signers add`.

## Prior Art

This spec is based on [`nuget trusted-signers`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-trusted-signers).

## Unresolved Questions

Is this the right UX? Does the naming make sense? This is a fairly complex/complicated feature and we want to make sure we deliver something to customers that makes sense and gives an overall good experience.
