# NuGet Home

The Home repository is the starting point for people to learn about NuGet, the project. If you're new to NuGet, and want to add packages to your own projects, [check our docs](http://docs.nuget.org). This repo contains pointers to the various GitHub repositories used by NuGet and allows folks to learn more about what's coming in NuGet.

NuGet is being actively developed by the .NET Foundation. NuGet is the package manager for the Microsoft development platform including .NET. The [NuGet client tools](https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client) provide the ability to produce and consume packages. The [NuGet Gallery](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery) is the central package repository used by all package authors and consumers and has a live deployment at [www.nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org).

## Documentation and Further Learning

### [NuGet Docs](http://docs.nuget.org)

The NuGet Docs are the ideal place to start if you are new to NuGet. They are categorized in 3 broader topics:

* [Consume NuGet packages](http://docs.nuget.org/consume) in your projects;
* [Create NuGet packages](http://docs.nuget.org/create) to learn about packaging and publishing your own NuGet Packages;
* [Contribute to NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/contribute) gives an overview of how you can contribute to the various NuGet projects.

### [NuGet Blog](http://blog.nuget.org/)

The NuGet Blog is where we announce new features, write engineering blog posts, demonstrate proof-of-concepts and features under development.

## How to build NuGet VisualStudio extension

###Prerequisites:
- [VisualStudio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
- [VisualStudio 2015 SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb166441.aspx)
- [Windows 10 SDK](https://dev.windows.com/en-US/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
- Git 
- Powershell

###Steps to build the clients tools repo:
- Clone [NuGet.Client](https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client) Repo by running the following command `git clone https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client`
- Start powershell
- CD into the clone repo directory
- Run `.\build.ps1 -CleanCache`

######In case you have build issues please clean the local repo using `git clean -xdf` and retry building

####Notable .\build.ps1 switches
- `-SkipDev14` - builds only binaries targeting Visual Studio 15 (Dev15)
- `-SkipDev15` - builds only binaries targeting Visual Studio 2015 (Dev14)

Note that if only one of Visual Studio 2015 (Dev14) or Visual Studio 15 (Dev15) is installed, neither of the above switches is necessary - the script will build according to the installed version.

- `-SkipXProj` - skips building the NuGet.Core XProj projects
- `-SkipTests` - builds binaries, skips running tests
- `-SkipRestore` - builds without restoring first
- `-SkipSubmodules` - builds without updating submodules
- `-SkipILMerge` - builds without creating an ILMerged nuget.exe
- `-Fast` - skips tests, submodule updates, and ILMerged nuget.exe

###Build Artifacts
- (RepoRootFolder)\Artifacts - this folder will contain the Vsix and NuGet command-line
- (RepoRootFolder)\Nupkgs - this folder will contain all our projects packages

## NuGet Packages by the NuGet team

We dogfood all of our stuff. NuGet uses NuGet to build NuGet, so to speak. All of our NuGet packages, which you can use in your own projects as well, are available from [our NuGet.org profile page](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/nuget).
