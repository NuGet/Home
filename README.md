# NuGet Home

The Home repository is the starting point for people to learn about NuGet, the project. If you're new to NuGet, and want to add packages to your own projects, [check our docs](http://docs.nuget.org). This repo contains pointers to the various GitHub repositories used by NuGet and allows folks to learn more about what's coming in NuGet.

NuGet is being actively developed by the .NET Foundation. NuGet is the package manager for the Microsoft development platform including .NET. The [NuGet client tools](https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client) provide the ability to produce and consume packages. The [NuGet Gallery](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery) is the central package repository used by all package authors and consumers and has a live deployment at [www.nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org).

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
